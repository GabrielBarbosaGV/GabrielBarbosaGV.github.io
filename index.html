      <br>
      <br>

      As a software engineer, I&#39;ve dealt with a fair share of codebases and systems
      administration workflows, all of which possessed varying degrees of efficiency,
      when the metric is taken over all attributes of the routines, including clearness
      and testability, as opposed to merely amount of production code over time.
      That being so, I feel confident in my sense for professional, clean code, that
      does certainly value feature throughput, but especially values correctness and
      robustness. Effective testing pays more than it costs, doubling as validation and
      documentation, allowing the maintainers to be confident in what they produce,
      while also presenting an easier entry point for newcomers. Ultimately, to me,
      the pinnacle of coding beauty arrives in a well-informed usage of the functional
      style, with code and data sharing space, and random testing, such as
      QuickCheck.

      <br>
      <br>

      I&#39;ve been having a lot of fun in this profession, ever since I started, when I
      was still an undergraduate, up until now, after graduation. I studied in the
      Center of Informatics of the Federal University of Pernambuco.

<div class="relative"><div class="transition-all absolute py-4 w-full h-[700px] overflow-x-scroll opacity-0">HTMX is a HTML extension library that allows for asynchronous operations to alter the DOM. <br>
      One possible usage is the following, as shown in the technology&#39;s official page: <br><br>

      

<pre>  <code class="language-html">
    
&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.8.6">&lt;/script>
&lt;!-- have a button POST a click via AJAX -->
&lt;button hx-post="/clicked" hx-swap="outerHTML">
  Click Me
&lt;/button>
        
  </code>
</pre>

      <br>
      This will allow the result of the POST request, to path &quot;/clicked&quot;, to swap the content of the button.

      This HTML extension is great for not overengineering simple web-pages. To be fair, this very page
      might be overengineered, but I just love SvelteKit that much.

  <div class="transition-all absolute py-4 w-full h-[700px] overflow-x-scroll opacity-0">Haskell is an amazing and underrated functional programming language. Its type inference and concise syntax
    would make it very powerful, were it not left in the sidelines a good portion of time due to the mistification
    of monads and their usage.

    It&#39;s not possible to portray all of the good aspects of the language solely through a small code block, so I
    recommend taking a look at these videos:

    <div class="flex justify-center my-6"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RqvCNb7fKsg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen class="mx-2"></iframe>

<pre>  <code class="language-haskell">
    
module Main
import Data.Char

main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn "Do you like Haskell?"
    answer &lt;- getLine
    putStrLn $ if map toLower answer == "yes" then "One of fine tastes ;)" else "Wrong answer!"
      
  </code>
</pre></div>

  <div class="transition-all absolute py-4 w-full h-[700px] overflow-x-scroll opacity-0">We all know and love TypeScript. Dynamically typed languages should not bring problems on their own, if proper testing is done,
    but proramming just becomes a whole lot faster when the compiler is holding your hand through the process. Whilst not as powerful
    as Rust in its type system, it is possible to do a lot with TypeScript, and, for the purposes of the web, definitely more than enough.

    

<pre>  <code class="language-typescript">
    
function sentiment([s, ...strings]: string[], language, sentiment) {
  return s &amp;&amp; s === "is" ? `You appear to feel that ${language} is ${sentiment}`;
}

const lang = "TypeScript";
const sentiment = "awesome";

console.log(sentiment`${lang} is ${awesome}`);

// output: "You appear to feel that TypeScript is awesome"
      
  </code>
