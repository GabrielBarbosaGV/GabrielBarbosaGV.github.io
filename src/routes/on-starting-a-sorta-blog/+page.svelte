    Hello to all, as you might have guessed, my name is Gabriel Barbosa. I've decided
    to start writing a sorta blog as to share my thoughts and actually get feedback on
    them. Of course, since this site is static, I cannot actually add comments (maybe
    when I'm no longer feeling lazy), so I expect you to send me good ol' e-mails. If
    you're feeling like it, just click on the "GBGV" on the top left of the page. But
    let's get to the point - what's in it for you to read this at all?

        GETTING TO KNOW YOUR SOON-TO-BE FAVORITE RAMBLER
    </div>

    Well, my friend, say you make efforts towards being a clean coder, hate poorly
    written tests, wish you could use the tools you know are best (SvelteKit and 
    tailwind-css) at your job's jQueried spaghetti of a SEO hell website, and are
    kind of bummed that you just won't stop dying in your Tarkov raids - then
    you'll feel right at home here.

    <br />
    <br />

    To be real, I've no idea of what I'm doing. I just wanted to create a website
    using my favourite technologies, and wanted to use GitHub pages as well. If
    you somehow landed here, and end up enjoying a read, hell, so be it. I intend
    on writing on just about anything from philosophy to good food to programming,
    but especially programming, as that's what feeds me and I enjoy doing most.

    I don't know about you, but I was that guy that'd write functions with hundreds
    of LOC, true awful monstrosities of tangled functionality, and would dread the
    choice of career that made the simplest of change requests into a quest of
    faith and spite to unfrick the plopped mess of a product. It went on for a
    while, and I knew there ought to be better ways to write code. I loosely and
    gradually started adopting these choices through my own painful experiences,
    till a friend convinced me to finally give Clean Code a go. Twas a religious
    experience, I must say, and using the principles, to this day, makes life a tad
    easier every time you clean the playground of that legacy codebase.

    <br />

    While I've got Clean Architecture pending, I can only thank Robert C. Martin
    for clarifying so much on how to be clean. If you haven't read that book yet,
    get on it, you won't regret it.

    I'm not sure whether this'll be the first or last place people who read my posts
    end up, so let me know - and keep your hopes high. I know mine are, so here's to
    great things in the future. Cya! :D
