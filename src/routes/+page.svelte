            Everything you put into a web page has purpose, be it
            presentation-wise or content-wise. What do you want to
            say? How? Convey it through a story that might as well
            be thought of by the reader, to reach right out of the
            screen and into their interests.

            A bulleted list, for instance, draws attention through
            pauses and well-contained bits of information. The one
            youâ€™re looking at right now uses opacity to push the
            pauses further. (By the way, SEO-friendly, JavaScript
            does not swap the content, allowing web crawlers to
            read it)
