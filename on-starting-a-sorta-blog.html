<div class="text-purple-100 flex flex-col align-middle p-4"><div class="fold:mx-10 xl:mx-40 mx-2 text-justify">Hello to all, as you might have guessed, my name is Gabriel Barbosa. I&#39;ve decided
    to start writing a sorta blog as to share my thoughts and actually get feedback on
    them. Of course, since this site is static, I cannot actually add comments (maybe
    when I&#39;m no longer feeling lazy), so I expect you to send me good ol&#39; e-mails. If
    you&#39;re feeling like it, just click on the &quot;GBGV&quot; on the top left of the page. But
    let&#39;s get to the point - what&#39;s in it for you to read this at all?

    <div class="text-[25px] text-center my-6">GETTING TO KNOW YOUR SOON-TO-BE FAVORITE RAMBLER
    </div>

    Well, my friend, say you make efforts towards being a clean coder, hate poorly
    written tests, wish you could use the tools you know are best (SvelteKit and 
    tailwind-css) at your job&#39;s jQueried spaghetti of a SEO hell website, and are
    kind of bummed that you just won&#39;t stop dying in your Tarkov raids - then
    you&#39;ll feel right at home here.

    <br>
    <br>

    To be real, I&#39;ve no idea of what I&#39;m doing. I just wanted to create a website
    using my favourite technologies, and wanted to use GitHub pages as well. If
    you somehow landed here, and end up enjoying a read, hell, so be it. I intend
    on writing on just about anything from philosophy to good food to programming,
    but especially programming, as that&#39;s what feeds me and I enjoy doing most.

    <br>
    <br>

    I don&#39;t know about you, but I was that guy that&#39;d write functions with hundreds
    of LOC, true awful monstrosities of tangled functionality, and would dread the
    choice of career that made the simplest of change requests into a quest of
    faith and spite to unfrick the plopped mess of a product. It went on for a
    while, and I knew there ought to be better ways to write code. I loosely and
    gradually started adopting these choices through my own painful experiences,
    till a friend convinced me to finally give Clean Code a go. Twas a religious
    experience, I must say, and using the principles, to this day, makes life a tad
    easier every time you clean the playground of that legacy codebase.

    <br>
    <br>

    While I&#39;ve got Clean Architecture pending, I can only thank Robert C. Martin
    for clarifying so much on how to be clean. If you haven&#39;t read that book yet,
    get on it, you won&#39;t regret it.


    <br>
    <br>

    I&#39;m not sure whether this&#39;ll be the first or last place people who read my posts
    end up, so let me know - and keep your hopes high. I know mine are, so here&#39;s to
    great things in the future. Cya! :D
